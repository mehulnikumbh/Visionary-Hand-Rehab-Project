# Visionary-Hand-Rehab-Project
 
We will construct a deep learningbased object detection system tailored for ESP32 control, showcasing its application in providing assistance with grasping tasks.
This methodology provides a robust and efficient solution by leveraging advanced real-time object detection and trackingtechnologies, such as YOLOv8 and Google MediaPipe, to
ensure precise and reliable object identification.
